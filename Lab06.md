### AWS ECS: Elastic Container Service

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies deploying,
managing, and scaling containerized applications. It seamlessly integrates with AWS, offering a secure and flexible
solution for running workloads in the cloud or on-premises with Amazon ECS Anywhere.

Containerizing a Django app with Docker enhances productivity and consistency. Here’s why:

- **Stable and Consistent Environment**: Docker eliminates the “*it works on my machine*” problem by ensuring a
  consistent environment with all dependencies pre-installed. This allows you to reproduce the app seamlessly across
  different systems and servers, making local development, testing, and deployment more reliable.

- **Reproducibility and Portability**: A Dockerized app packages all its dependencies, environment variables, and
  configurations, guaranteeing it runs the same way across various environments. This simplifies deployment and reduces
  compatibility issues.

- **Improved Team Collaboration**: With Docker, every developer works in an identical environment, preventing conflicts
  caused by different system setups. Shared Docker images streamline onboarding and reduce setup time.

- **Faster Deployment**: Docker accelerates project setup by automating environment configuration, so developers can
  start coding right away. It ensures uniformity across development, staging, and production, making it easier to
  integrate and deploy changes.
