The field of Machine Learning has experienced remarkable growth, driven by advances in computing, massive data storage, and internet technologies. Many aspects of daily life, both directly and indirectly, are influenced by ML—from speech recognition and image classification on smartphones to spam detection in emails. Just a decade ago, such applications seemed like science fiction. ML has also revolutionized stock market predictions and medical research, with further societal impacts expected from autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics.

Deep Learning, a specialized branch of ML, has seen explosive growth since its resurgence in 2006. Many Silicon Valley startups focus on this field, and major tech companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM have dedicated research teams. Interest in DL extends beyond academia, with mainstream publications such as Wired, The New York Times, and Bloomberg covering its rapid advancements. This enthusiasm has drawn students, entrepreneurs, and investors into the field, further driving innovation.

Open-source projects have played a crucial role in DL’s expansion. Having contributed to the development of Caffe at Berkeley in 2012, I recognize TensorFlow—developed by Google, where I have been conducting research since 2013—as a key tool for researchers and small businesses. The expertise of top engineers and researchers behind this project ensures its impact.

I hope this book serves as a valuable introduction for those eager to explore this exciting field. I also commend the author, whom I have the pleasure of knowing, for his dedication to making this technology accessible. Remarkably, he wrote the first Spanish edition just two months after TensorFlow’s open-source release—an example of Barcelona’s growing role in this transformative technological landscape.
