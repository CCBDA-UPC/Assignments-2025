#  Tasks for Lab session #1
## Task 1.1:
Install Python on your laptop.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a very popular [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that will make your life much easier. It supports execution and debugging of Python, Python environments, code version control, it has a built-in terminal and all kinds of plugins. Moreover, it is [completely free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/classroom/?product=pycharm). **Make sure you install PyCharm Pro** version.

You can [create a new PyCharm project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-managing-projects.html) and [Configure a virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)

Create a folder for the assignment `Lab1` and install a Python virtual environment under a folder named `Lab1/venv`

Activate the virtual environment and install the necessary pip packages.


## Task 1.2:
Create a python code that uses the “random” library. Build a program in python that generates a random number between 1 and 20. Then let the player guess the number entered, displaying if the number is too low or high. The game ends either when the number is guessed correctly. The suggested program name is `Lab1.guessnumber.py`.

If you are using PyCharm try to become familiar with the integrated debugger. You will need to debug your code in future sessions. On the top-right part of the IDE:

Create a new configuration to run each Python Script:

Just to become familiar with the IDE, set some break points and examine the variables.


## Task 1.3:

Use the `private repository` **https://github.com/CCBDA-UPC/2025-1-xx** that you have received where you and your team partner need to leave your responses. **(Replace xx using the repository name that you have been asigned)**.

Populate the `private repository` with the contents that you have just cloned.

```
echo "# 2025-1-xx" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git add Lab1.guessnumber.py
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/CCBDA-UPC/2025-1-xx.git
git push -u origin master
```

It is better that you manage git by hand. Once you become familiar with git you can use PyCharm to save you some typing.

## Task 1.4:
Update the `README.md` file including all the information about your group (member's name and email addresses).

## Task 1.5:
Don't forget to **individually** submit the knowledge check of the AWS Academy course.

> :question: **Question 1**: How long have you been working on this session? What have been the main difficulties you have faced and how have you solved them? Add your answers to `README.md`.


# How to submit this assignment:

Push to the repo, at least, the files `README.md` with your responses to the above questions. Make sure that your explanations are clear and explain what you've done to complete each of the above steps.

Make sure that you have updated your local GitHub repository (using the `git`commands `add`, `commit` and `push`) with all the files generated during this session.


**Before the deadline**, all teams shall push their responses to their private **https://github.com/CCBDA-UPC/2025-1-xx** repository.
